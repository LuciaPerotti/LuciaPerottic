            A NOTE FROM OUR FOUNDER
        </h1>
        <p>
            My journey towards healthier skin inspired me to develop products that really work, in a way that’s accessible to everyone. <br>
            Rhode is dedicated to making products based in science and great formulation, simplifying many of the mysteries and complex narratives behind efficacious skincare. <br>
            I hope these will become your go-to essentials that can live in your bathroom, be your favorite travel companion, improve your skin over time, and keep your skin happy and hydrated.
