            The Rhode Futures Foundation is investing in and supporting 1000 women* and their families by 2023. We are partnering with three organizations that provide women, especially women of color, with the resources needed to direct their own futures: Accion Opportunity Fund, Black Mamas Matter Alliance, and the LIFT Family Goal Fund. Rhode has committed a minimum of 1% of sales to support their efforts and the women they serve.
            <br>
            *For all women, including non-binary, trans, non-cis, and all women-identified persons.

                Black Mamas Matter Alliance, Inc. (BMMA) is a national network of Black women-led organizations and multi-disciplinary professionals that works across the full spectrum of maternal and reproductive health. BMMA operates at the national, state, and local levels to advance policy, promote holistic maternity care, cultivate research, and uplift culture to advance Black Maternal Health for Black women and birthing people. We envision a world where all Black mamas have the rights, respect, and resources to thrive before, during, and after pregnancy.

                LIFT is a national non-profit that invests in low-income families to break generational cycles of poverty and promotes wellbeing, social connection, and financial stability. LIFT strengthens families by providing cash buffers to parents (mostly moms) so they can work toward long-term success. With LIFT’s support, mothers reinvest in their careers, further their goals, and provide a better future for themselves and their families—regardless of race, ethnicity, or zip code.            </p>
